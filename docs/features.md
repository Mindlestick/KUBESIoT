- <b>LION</b> is a lightweight IoT platform developed to facilitate device management based on Edge Computing technology.
- By registering/modifying/deleting IoT devices in the LION server, you can expect a lighter and faster response than existing developed products.
- By supporting the resource browser, it is possible to quickly respond to the status of the edge IoT device.
- Provides user convenience in device management by providing resource creation and deletion in the Resource Browser.
- These programs can be used to effectively manage IoT devices.
- We developed it on the premise that the device can be registered on the LION server, and the device registration function will be additionally implemented in the future.
